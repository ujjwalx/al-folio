I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Amsterdam under the supervision of [Prof. Willemijn van Dolen](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/d/o/w.m.vandolen/w.m.vandolen.html){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Stevan Rudinac](https://www.uva.nl/profile/r/u/s.rudinac/s.rudinac.html){:target="\_blank"}.

My current research is focussed on combining geospatial, visual, textual and mobility data to recommend optimal venues for retail establishments. The broader goal is to develop techniques that can automatically recommend store locations consistent for a particular retail type as well as a suitable visual ‘look-and-feel’ using algorithmically-learnt successful location and design choices. 

My research interests lie in problems centred around multimodal learning with real-world data. Previously, I have also worked on task-driven scene-understanding problems as a part of my [Master thesis](https://esc.fnwi.uva.nl/thesis/centraal/files/f2119681021.pdf){:target="\_blank"} at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/){:target="\_blank"}.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from VIT University, Vellore, India in 2016 and my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands in 2018.
